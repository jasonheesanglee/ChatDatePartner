`ChatDatePartner` is your own virtual girlfriend.<br><br>
While brainstorming ideas to address the declining birth rate, a persistent problem in Korea, we realized that a decline in romantic relationships contributes to declining marriage rates, which is one cause of low birth rates.<br>
We started this project by developing a dating simulator using a chatbot to solve the vague fear of dating caused by conversations with the opposite gender.<br>
The project started as `ChatGirlFriend` but during the planning and development process, we realized that there would also be female users, so we changed it to `ChatDatePartner`<br><br>
Currently, the IDs such as `user_id`, `session_id` are manually generated.<br>
The IDs will be replaced by the actual `user_ids` and `session_ids`, etc.<br><br>
